                        <h3>Hooks</h3>
                        <p>Hooks are used to catch fish by poking them in the mouth when they come in for a nibble, although in some cases they end up getting caught in the fish’s body.</p>
                        <p>You might need different fish hooks to catch fish in different size. Hook sizes range from number 32 (smallest) to 19/0 (largest). There are also various types of hooks, such as single, double, circle, and treble. </p>
                        <p>You can install hooks on lures or put baits on the hooks.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="lures">

                        <h3>Lures</h3>
                        <p>Fishing lures are usually artificial baits that are designed to mimic real fish in order to get the attention of predators. Fishers have these stored in their tackle box in case they’ve run out of live bait or simply prefer to use plastic, non-moving ones. For some, the variety of lures makes it easier for them to hunt specific types of fish and allows them to be successful in different weather and water conditions.</p>
                        <p>For example, light-colored lures are ideal for bright days and clear water, while dark-colored lures are used on cloudy days and in murky waters. Two-toned plastic worms (with a darker head and bright tail color) are also great for cloudy waters.</p>

                    <div class="baits">
                        <img class="bait-1" src="./images/bait-1.jpg " alt="fishing-baits">
                        <h3>Baits</h3>
                        <p>Different types of fish are attracted to different types of food. Bait is what you place on the hooks to attract the fish. They can be worms, small fish, or bread.</p>
                        <p>You can get live bait at your local bait shop or simply dig up the worms in your backyard on a dewy night, store them in a tin can with grass and soil, and place the container in a cold, dim place until you’re ready to take them out.</p>

                    <div class="sinkers">

                        <h4>Sinkers</h4>
                        <p>Another important piece of equipment that you’ll need is a sinker. For every line you cast, you’ll need to attach one so your line will stabilize as your lightweight hook and bait sinks deeper. </p>
