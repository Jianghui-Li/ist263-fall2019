                <h3>Nylon Monofilament Lines</h3>
                <img class="mono-line" src="./images/mono-line.jpg " alt="mono-line">
                <p>A single strand of nylon and often referred to simply as “mono". Monofilament can be extruded from different materials, but nylon is by far the most common and popular medium.</p>
                <p>Monofilament fishing lines absorb water, which means they behave differently beneath the surface than when you’re testing them in the tackle shop.</p>

                <h3>Braided Lines</h3>
                <img class="braided-fishing-line-1" src="./images/braided-fishing-line-1.jpg " alt="braided-line">
                <p>Fused or braided strands of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene and commonly referred to as ”braid” or “braided” line.</p>
                <p>Braids are very visible in the water. For that reason, many fishermen do not like it in clear water. However, Braided lines are hard to break, so it can be used to fight strong and less sensitive fish.</p>

                <h3>Fluorocarbon Lines</h3>
                <img class="fluoro" src="./images/fluoro.jpg " alt="fluoro-line">
                <p>A single strand of polyvinylidene fluoride.</p>
                <p>One of fluorocarbon's biggest benefits is it's nearly invisible underwater (it has nearly the same refractive index as water).</p>
                <p>Unlike mono and some superlines, fluoro doesn't absorb water. This means it has the same strength, sensitivity and handling below the surface as it does when dry.</p>
