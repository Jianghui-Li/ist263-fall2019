            <h3>Feeder rods</h3>
            <img class="feeder" src="./images/feeder.jpg" alt="feeder">
            <p>Feeder rods are also known as quiver tip rods, because they come supplied with between one and three quiver tips. A feeder rod is used for fishing with bait on the bottom, without the use of a float, so are a great tool for carp fishing.</p>
            <img class="feeder-2" src="./images/feeder-2.jpg" alt="feeder">
            <p>In Asia and Europe, people tend to use feeder rods because people like catching carp species.</p>
            <p>You will need to attach a feeder on the fishing line, so the feeder can attract the fish. Large feeders obviously give you the chance to send out larger amounts of bait on each cast. Heavier weights will let you cast further on larger lakes but be sure to match the feeder weight with your rod. Rods with lighter action will struggle to cope with heavy feeders especially with the fine quiver tip ends. Heavier feeders will also stick better if you are fishing slopes on the lake bed and stop them from sliding your hookbait away from your baited swim.</p>

They can't be used in the same manner as regular 2-3 piece rods, fighting and catching a big fish with them is different and more fun.

            <img class="pole-2" src="./images/pole-2.jpg" alt="pole">
            <p>Telescopic rods are big, long and taper to a fine tip ended with strong Braid Lilian String connected to the tip. This string greatly enhances the sensitivity of the pole for detecting slightest strikes. Unlike spinning fishing rods, telescopic rods do not require reels. Only rod, line, float, weight and hook are used.</p>
