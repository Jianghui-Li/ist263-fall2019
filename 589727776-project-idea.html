    <h1>Fishing gear descriptions and suggestions</h1>
    <p>I want to create a webpage that explains how to fishing gears work. 
        For example, I will provide information about rod, reel, and line physics.
        Moreover, I will render some ideas of how to use correct setup to catch different fish species.
        For instances, why are there many people use casting rods and reels to catch large sea fish.
        These information will help with <abbr title="Anglers of all abilities">AAA.
    </p>
